# UM Visa Project

## 1.0 Introduction and Problem Context

### 1.1. Overview of Chosen SDG
The UM VISA MATE project is dedicated to Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities. Specifically, it aligns with Target 10.7, which focuses on facilitating orderly, safe, regular, and responsible migration and mobility of people.

### 1.2. Problem Context
International students at Universiti Malaya (UM) often face significant administrative hurdles during the visa renewal process. The current system relies heavily on physical travel between faculty offices and the UM Visa Unit, which is paper-based and often opaque. This creates stress and high costs for students and leads to non-compliance penalties if the critical three-month renewal window is missed. These financial and administrative barriers promote inequality by forcing students to rely on expensive third-party agents.

### 1.3. Relevance of Proposed Mobile Application
UM VISA MATE is a purpose-built mobile application designed to digitize and centralize the student pass renewal journey. By creating a single digital pipeline, the app promotes equal opportunity (SDG 10.3) by standardizing instructions and eliminating the need for costly agents. It ensures orderly mobility (SDG 10.7) through automated reminders and real-time status tracking, ensuring students maintain safe and legal status throughout their studies.

This repository contains the source code for the UM Visa Project, a university application developed by our team. The project is structured into several modules, each representing a core function of the application.
